# Piracy Wars
A game inspired by Pacman and other classic arcade games. Its purpose is to educate children on the dangers and illegality of piracy. The user must collect as many pirated CDs as possible without being caught by the criminals who make and sell pirated material. This game was my first major computer science project.
